# Voiceprint

Voiceprint is a speaker identification system built using TensorFlow and MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features extracted from audio data. This project leverages deep learning to recognize individual speakers based on their voice patterns.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Develop a model to identify speakers from audio samples, with potential for deployment on resource-constrained devices using TensorFlow Lite.
- **Features**: Extracts MFCCs, trains a CNN model, and evaluates performance with training/validation metrics.
