**Voiceprint** is a speaker identification system based on [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain), a PyTorch-based toolkit for speech processing. This project aims to create a lightweight, efficient, and portable solution for identifying speakers from short audio samples.

<p align="center">‚ö†Ô∏èüöß EXPERIMENTAL & WORK IN PROGRESS üöß‚ö†Ô∏è</p>

## Voiceprint Core Library

The core library provides functionality to:

- Create and manage voice libraries
- Add and remove speakers and samples
- Identify speakers from audio inputs

## Dashboard

The Dashboard is a web-based GUI for interacting with Voiceprint:

- Create or import voice libraries
- Record and enroll speaker samples
- Perform speaker identification
- Export libraries for external use

### Running the Dashboard

Requires Docker and Docker Compose:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/loque/voiceprint.git
   cd voiceprint
   ```

2. Build and start services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to access the Dashboard.

## Wyoming Voiceprint

Wyoming Voiceprint is a Voiceprint wrapper to integrate with the Wyoming protocol.
